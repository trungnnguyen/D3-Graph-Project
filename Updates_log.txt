May 6, 2017. Alex.
Changes:
(1) (works) I changed scripts.js to split options() and makegraph() so that I could call makegraph directly with the Poisson data.
(2) COO. - works
(3) Styling. - this looks fine
(4) Poisson data. - works
(5)(removed) Added console save from a Github, it lets you save Json files directly to text. I used this to create the Poisson.json data file. I first ran our code on Poisson.csv via input, and then ran console.save on it from the Chrome developer browser.


Issues:
(1) Unable to get the Poisson.csv to start at run time. fixed
Things I tried:
jQuery.get, jQuery.json, d3.json-- I think they are all the same. The thing I learned here is that you have to use a callback function, or else it will try to run makegraph at run time.

(2) Unable to move CSS styling to the style sheet, even after I call the stylesheet after the bootstrap styles. - fixed
